// Rust has a special type named ! thatâ€™s known in type theory lingo as the empty type
// because it has no values. We prefer to call it the never type
// because it stands in the place of the return type when a function will never return.
// Here is an example:

fn bar() -> ! {
    panic!("Blub");
    // continue is also of type !
}
